# BullDozer-Price-Prediction (Collab Notebook)
This project is a collaborative notebook that uses machine learning techniques to predict the price of bulldozers. The notebook is built using Python and the popular machine learning library, Scikit-learn. It is a great resource for those interested in machine learning and predictive analytics for the construction industry, as it demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict bulldozer prices using real-world data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have access to Google Colab, a free Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to write and run Python code in the cloud. You can access it by signing in with your Google account here.

## Usage
1. To start using the notebook, follow these steps:

2. Open the Google Colab notebook by clicking on the `bulldozer_price_prediction.ipynb` file in the repository.

3. Click the 'Open in Colab' button to open the notebook in Google Colab.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and build a machine learning model to predict bulldozer prices.

5. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance on a test set of data.

6. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
